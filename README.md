Introduction
Brain tumor classification is a critical task in medical imaging, which helps radiologists and clinicians detect and identify the type of brain tumor present in MRI scans. The project enhances DenseNet architecture by making adjustments to the number of layers, adding regularization, and experimenting with hyperparameters to improve performance in tumor classification.

The model is trained to classify MRI brain images into distinct categories:

No Tumor
Meningioma Tumor
Glioma Tumor
Pituitary Tumor
The enhanced DenseNet architecture is used because of its efficient feature propagation and gradient flow, which allows for deeper networks without experiencing vanishing gradient issues.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available and contains MRI images of brain tumors. Each image is labeled with one of the categories: "No Tumor", "Meningioma Tumor", "Glioma Tumor", or "Pituitary Tumor."

Example of Dataset Structure:
Image	Label
brain_mri_001.jpg	No Tumor
brain_mri_002.jpg	Glioma Tumor
brain_mri_003.jpg	Meningioma Tumor
brain_mri_004.jpg	Pituitary Tumor
Source of Dataset: The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle - Brain Tumor MRI Dataset.

Dataset Summary:
No Tumor: 980 images
Meningioma Tumor: 937 images
Glioma Tumor: 926 images
Pituitary Tumor: 901 images
Model Architecture
The model is based on an enhanced version of DenseNet, which is known for efficient use of model parameters and strong feature propagation.

Enhancements in the DenseNet Architecture:
Deeper Layers: The network has been extended to capture more detailed features by increasing the number of DenseNet blocks.
Regularization: Dropout and weight decay (L2 regularization) have been added to prevent overfitting.
Custom Output Layer: The output layer is adjusted to match the number of categories in the dataset (4 classes).
Data Augmentation: To improve generalization, data augmentation techniques like random rotation, zoom, and flip have been applied.
DenseNet Model Code Example:
python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.applications import DenseNet121
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Load pre-trained DenseNet model
base_model = DenseNet121(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Add custom layers on top of DenseNet
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = Dropout(0.5)(x)  # Add dropout for regularization
x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dropout(0.5)(x)
predictions = Dense(4, activation='softmax')(x)  # 4 classes

# Create the final model
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
Preprocessing
Before training the model, the MRI images need to be preprocessed:

Resizing: All images are resized to 224x224 pixels to match the input size required by DenseNet.
Normalization: Pixel values are normalized to fall within the range [0, 1].
Data Augmentation: Data augmentation techniques like random flips, rotations, and zooms are applied to improve model generalization.
python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1./255,
    validation_split=0.2,  # 20% validation split
    rotation_range=30,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True
)
Training
The enhanced DenseNet model is trained using the preprocessed dataset with early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Training Parameters:
Batch Size: 32
Epochs: 50
Optimizer: Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001
Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy
Metrics: Accuracy
Training example:

python
Copy code
history = model.fit(
    train_generator,
    validation_data=validation_generator,
    epochs=50,
    steps_per_epoch=train_steps,
    validation_steps=val_steps,
    callbacks=[early_stopping]
)
Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the model, the following metrics are used:

Accuracy: Proportion of correctly classified images.
Precision: True positives divided by all positive predictions.
Recall: True positives divided by all actual positives.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Generate predictions
y_pred = model.predict(test_generator)
y_pred_classes = y_pred.argmax(axis=-1)

# Classification report
print(classification_report(y_true, y_pred_classes, target_names=['No Tumor', 'Meningioma', 'Glioma', 'Pituitary']))
